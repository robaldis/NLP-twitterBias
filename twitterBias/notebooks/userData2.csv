>156.0,@yobeccz Even when I think I’m eating sugar  MFP says I ate sugar.The best receiver in the NFL. https://t.co/7IEWP61Mwu@EGPRCHAMP Kim’s Convenience after a football Sunday that couldn’t have gone better! https://t.co/BWijeTpLyO@michaelphigham @jagster7985 Can I chop it up with you guys? I’m chomping at the bit waiting for my CS4 review code.😅@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers Especially in a system like Matt LaFleur’s where it’s hard for a rookie to pick it up.  The best draft pick on the field today might’ve even been Josiah DeGuara.  Nobody called that.@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers Can’t look back at that now. Remember we picked 3 receivers in the draft two years ago. 2 are still on the team. The time to rate that draft is after this year.  They’re not meant to be judged immediately.@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers The Achilles heel aside from the poor run defense?  Aaron Rodgers not playing like the bad man that he is.Even San Francisco folded because of talent deficiency at QB once Mahomes started rolling.@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers SF did that to MIN too last year  and they supposedly had a good run defense.Every opponent has to be played differently  and we had a rock solid plan at MIN today. Just go out there and execute. Rodgers will be the first to tell you he didn’t execute in Santa Clara too.😂 https://t.co/AOHUtT98aohttps://t.co/QuDOvzV3gj https://t.co/ZB6cpA7lO0SoFi Stadium looks like an upside down swoosh. I dig it. Love to go to a game or an event there once we’re allowed to.Like how did they get Marshawn to do this commercial when Skittles aren’t involved?I love this chips commercial.Robert Woods. Cooper Kupp.  And now Van Jefferson. Rams doing much more than Dallas’ unheralded offense.@RaffRaff73 Played 12 games. New system. Did next to nothing his rookie year. Consistency. These experts are acting like the Cowboys have had a high-octane passing offense for years.@RaffRaff73 He’s fine. I wanna see a full season of consistency. Further breakout candidate sure.Carrie Underwood is wearing pants so moms can stop complaining about the SNF intro being too sexualized.The only proven receiver Dallas has is Amari Cooper  and I’m sorry to say it  America... he’s not Dak good either.

Intimidated by the know-it-all types in the earlier years  I always assumed it'd be the opposite.@hagmonk The same tricks don't always apply to distributed traces because most language runtimes don't have a canonical context propagation standard and propagating trace in the same process is also tricky. Auto-instrumenting the web/RPC framework is often the best bet.Unless you can't link into your users' frameworks  it's hard to provide out-of-the-box distributed traces as a platform provider. You can start them  participate in them  you may even provide automatic ones for service calls but end-to-end traces require user participation.@fatiher99 Insanlari fakir birakmakla ovunmek boyle bir sey.

>11493602.0,"Is this image... 1. A Hermann grid illusion from my HCI classor 2. An instructor's view of their students on Zoom after 4 weeks of classes. https://t.co/WwTGXOFF1uSo I think it's a reasonable assumption that many PUIs which were approved to hire a CS faculty member last year would be looking to hire again this year under normal circumstances.Since we're all under heavy financial constraints  seeing who *can* hire is interesting.For those not in CS who follow me  you should know that CS currently lives in an academia bizarro world in which most PUIs desperately need faculty and often fail searches (https://t.co/7mS7D62ZOo).1.5 weeks later  each point in this thread is only amplified. Ads compared to last year are sloooooooow. That's not surprising  but I gotta say  the unpredictability of *who* can still hire leaves me a bit baffled. Zero correlation with resources/rankings. https://t.co/XJtgGWgfHgA silver lining to constantly creating videos is that I'm more comfortably constantly creating videos. Why did I ever give design feedback in my HCI course any other way? Walking through and annotating @AdobeXD prototypes via @loom &gt;&gt;&gt; bullet point text feedback.This project looks fantastic. Congratulations @crystaljjlee! https://t.co/8y6z7oVMs4It's an overwhelming semester  but please don't forget to nominate undergraduates who deserve to be awarded for their research. https://t.co/ILT1V3Ms7k@ngehlenborg Nah  MIT is in SVG-tier.So I understand how prestige bias can influence me on a hiring committee  but what's the bias called where I think less of a university because when I zoom in on their webpage  the logo is so low-def that I can tell it's pixelated even when I return to normal zoom levels?I'm happy to see more universities drop these exams as a requirement. https://t.co/v6Lz39vbU1@affectivecogntn @havillj Not just those skills. In HCI (my field)  taking psych or sociology would very likely set you up for success more than an additional physics or math or computer theory course. If your courses align with your program  it's better. I don't like making BS/BA distinctions.We address this explicitly in CS orientations  and I've gotten into a habit of directly poking the topic when I bring in alumni panels  but I would like to improve the messaging *before students arrive on campus*CS alum I talk to never regret the BA because it gave them flexibility to explore other topics that often empower their current careers. But my students often feel shame and pressure about switching from BS to BA.Part of my motivation is seeing if departments are crafting good public-facing resources that undermine the implicit hierarchy that many students seem to internalize that BA is *less than* BS.@djp3 I think this happens a lot on a personal advising level  but I'm curious what kind of public-facing resources departments have.@AllenDowney Are you saying that offering both a BA and BS might suggest a failure to reach consensus on departmental objectives?I want to make sure I'm following.Question for those in CS depts that offer both BA and BS degrees. I ran across a university this morning that had really terrible guidance on why students should choose one or the other. I have my own take on this  but I'm curious what guidance you provide students.This is still the most personally meaningful project I've been part of. Thanks @Data_Soul! https://t.co/fF9hBFZwjDVery happy to see a vis paper on this topic. Articulating the goals of public visualizations in a more principled way is a critical step to making the right design decisions. https://t.co/t12Wwpv8WrOur context: - Bucknell has 3000+ students on campus (&gt; 90%). Many profs are teaching in-person.- We've had a very slow trickle of COVID-19 cases (13 in total)  but no spikes yet. So ...  this could be the best it's going to get this semester.3. Keeping universities afloat right now demands *so much* extra time and attention this semester. Popular tweets are like ""Educators  take must the weekend off! You deserve it!"" I agree... but the tradeoff isn't some abstract committee  it's my students.Like many schools  Bucknell eliminated mid-semester breaks so we can send students home for the semester at Thanksgiving. I thought it was a great decision to prevent COVID  but students desperately needed that break to regroup and rest during the best of times. Now what?2. I'm pretty concerned about students over the course of the semester. I've seen energy and enthusiasm degrade over 3 weeks at about twice the speed of a normal semester. This whole experience is exhausting for everyone  and we have to do it for 11 (?!) more weeks.(1 continued..)I will never mandate cameras on + I'm happy they are seeing each other... but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't on a little demoralizing on my end. The good news is that I can still see that 90% of the class is engaged via frequent clicker questions.Bucknell is now 20% through the semester. 3 early observations from 3+ weeks of remote lecturing: I do lots of activities in Zoom break-out rooms. I'm noticing students are starting to turn off their camera when we're all together  but put them on during smaller interactions.Two follow-up thoughts: - I hate making errors  but I'm very comfortable with laughing at my mistakes and not getting derailed during class. - These moments always remind me of how often I'm afforded the benefit of the doubt by students in ways that other  colleagues are not@jdcshaverford @martyjwolf Somehow  I've included a ""None above"" or ""I'm not sure"" in every clicker question during the 3 weeks *before* this lecture.  Fortunately  these are no-stakes assessments (anonymous  for in-class reflection on comprehension)I managed to create 2 different clicker questions for CS 1 students today in which the correct answer wasn't *any* of the options on the screen. At least my lectures aren't recorded and preserved on the internet forever this semester  right?

>11615212.0,Great thing about Twitter as opposed to FB is no one fuckin cares! (Flip side: no bad advice)I am so disappointed in people but mostly in myself. I’ve been making difficult things work for a long time but I’m out of cognitive and emotional resources. At the worst possible time.*compromised*illThe best one I got was “check out Queer Exchange”  which is a Facebook group I started when I wasn’t as I’ll  back in 2011 or so. There are local versions all over the place now. I’m now too old and too disabled to be very valuable in those spaces.I know personal connections are hard to come by and it’s not that I think people are holding out on me. Times are hard  and even in my comprised state I have relative privilege. What I don’t understand is advice like “check out Craigslist”.The problem is not that I don’t have the imagination or Google skills to identify “cute queer towns”. The problem is I don’t have the income and credit and etc to qualify to rent from randos. I need personal connections.A recurring one is “You should check out Northampton”. I am a 40-something queer person  loosely lesbian-affiliated. You’ll be shocked to know I have indeed heard of Northampton!I can barely put words together but I’ve been using all of my energy for 6 months trying to claw back my tenuous connections  see if anyone knows anyone or anything. I get a lot of clueless advice.I have been trying in earnest since about April (was trying half-heartedly before then) to organize a life I can afford on disability income. It means leaving the city  both because I think nature might help and because I couldn’t afford it before &amp; really can’t now.I have been depressed for so long that stay-at-home orders hardly phased me. What was different is I had so few connections left because I’d been staying home and people had already forgotten I existed.

When they first opened in 1951  it was vaguely Mexican-themed interiors  though with standard American steakhouse menus. https://t.co/PPi4mxMRlM@mrgan Whoa  just found this ad from April 1  1953.

This testing shortage is a big problem.“but I think that’s right as that’s where the biggest risk is.

But one year as a football player — there’s a whole other crop of rookies coming in to take your job.” — @Foxworth24To all those worried that the pandemic stalled their Netflix shows…“The Crown is coming this winter.” — @reedhastings: https://t.co/znbZquVR00The NFL has been criticized when addressing players’ medical issues. Is that changing? “I asked that of everyone I talked to  including the commissioner: do we want to really be leaders in sports medicine? And he said yes.” — @NFL doc Allen Sills https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBb“This book is all the things I wish I knew when I started that first company and about the importance of being direct and honest in a professional setting.” — @reedhastings on his new book co-written by @ErinMeyerINSEAD. https://t.co/znbZquVR00“You want to be right up to that edge where it's dynamic and there's freedom. It has not fallen into chaos  but it's right on the edge of it.” — @reedhastings on his business strategy of leading by context: https://t.co/znbZquVR00What are some of the key rules of having no rules? 1. Hire the best people (but no brilliant jerks).  2. Empower them. https://t.co/znbZquVR00Some NFL team owners are thinking of allowing fans at games at 25% capacity. Dr. Thom Mayer from the @NFLPA — “We’re not against it.

But I think where the tipping points are have changed wildly and mental models aren’t keeping up@sarahdrinkwater Definitely. I think also the thesis that undivided attention leads to change is no longer true at all either.This feels useful to reflect on because this line has been used by EVERYONE  for causes I agree with and don’t. It casts your group as the underdogs and is never refutable because undivided attention is impossible these days; a parallel is TikTokers claiming they’re shadowbannedthe overarching thing to dig into here is the obsession with getting “people” to care more in our current reality of fractured feeds and attention. how much is sufficiently “more”? what do we imagine that care translating into? what does withheld attention insinuate? https://t.co/V5vqAO1pzj@jettfu @doougle Great to hear  Jett!

Almost always they ask for just one more day.@JMUlibraries @LiuJh_Christie Thank you so much for giving students a place where they can participate in an online class!!@JMU continued...good - smart to move online as soon as things got badgood - decided to publicly share infection numbersgood - requires masks on campus all the timeso good - still have a job and can work from home!!What's good/bad COVID-wise at your college rn? Here is my list for @JMU : bad - let go of almost all adjuncts  our most vulnerablebad - so now everyone in my dept teaching an overloadbad - lack of COVID entry testing &amp; contact testing(good to follow in the next tweet!)@Billy__Price Usually I just rewrite the structure of the sentence or split into two phrases. I'm trying to avoid nesting to increase simplicity/clarity. An editor once suggested to me ""if it's worth including at all then maybe it deserves to be in its own thought/sentence"" and i was like oh!@rileypb @henryseg I think you mean ""Rather than cold!""@henryseg Today I wrote an email to a student and before sending I did the usual look-over and found that all three of my sentences ended with exclamation points@henryseg my eyes!@Al_Th ah but can you break ALL of the rules?To be clear  all of these rules are here to run cleanup since my natural tendency is to do the oppositeAnother rule I follow is to rewrite to get better linebreaks. Which I did above  but apparently Twitter has fewer chars per line when displayed than when entering  ugh@daniel_bilar I’m a big fan of #3This are my rewriting/revising rules  what are yours?(a) eliminate all parentheses (b) split long sentences into separate ones(c) with every ""if..."" add the actual word ""then""(d) replace ""it"" and ""this"" with specific phrases(e) remove all but one ""!"" if there are any"

>26853.0,I remember in 2008 suddenly having to learn about the LIBOR from @planetmoney to understand the financial crisis. I grew up in LA in the 80s and the AQI was on the news regularly. It fell away in the early 2000s as air quality improved but is back now with a vengeance.The Index Index: a metric of societal health based on how many niche technical indices the general public needs to be aware of due to them hitting a dangerous spike.@hondanhon @vgr Yes this is awfully close to your ‘Q is structured like an ARG’ take. Here I was thinking less of its experience design and more of its ‘job to be done’ for the ‘players’.@vgr Do you think things like QAnon and alt-everything/conspiracy-Chans act as escapism for some people? More a “meaning and purpose” LARP than actually seeking meaning and purpose.@vgr I guess we’re in my rewatch loop now :)@vgr Ah gotcha. Yeah. Great monster of the week TV is a niche that contemporary digital services are super bad at filling. Telling a full story in an hour’s a lot harder than keeping a serialized ball rolling. Might be a lost art at this point.@vgr You know what’s the perfect escapism now that it’s basically become sci-fi? The West Wing@vgr DS9 too dark for effective escapism?@vgr How do you feel about Star Trek? Are TNG  DS9  or Voyager part of your supply?@ptychomancer By “synthesis” I really mean good transitions between topics.@ptychomancer Can I vote for tight focus on a synthesis of those topics?@vgr Can I select all of 1-3?@anildash Have you caught the @blaseball bug yet?@flantz Hi Frank. You’re up late.@flantz “AI will render useless all but the set of skills I happen to have” is the new “the lesson of X election result is that Democrats should adopt my policy preferences”.@fredbenenson Yeah I guess I’m curious what specifically you’re thinking of when you say “principled” or “traditional” libertarianism. There’s a number of different views that fly under that flag. And many of them  let’s say  don’t effectively wrestle with the consequences of their beliefs.@fredbenenson Gotcha. Yeah aligned. I misinterpreted what you meant by “hollow”. For me the Gawker Affair (and these Trump revelations) showed me Thiel’s libertarianism was filled with exactly what’s always inside right libertarianism.@fredbenenson Lotta “no true Scotsman” energy in this thread. Whatever right libertarianism may be on paper in practice it always comes down to “freedom for me but not for thee”.@slavin_fpo Case in point: https://t.co/GNJfBCqXCi@slavin_fpo Well you’ve got to factor in the increasing number  virulence  and insanity of the adversaries along with our new superpower of having total panoptic vision into all the crazy  stupid  evil shit people say to each other.@flantz @metasynthie @NYUGameCenter I want to hear the two of you say interesting things about Blaseball!@thomasfuchs Just watch TNG  DS9  or Voyager again.@slavin_fpo I  for one  definitely didn’t think that climate denial would advance to the point of people literally looking at a giant fucking fire and saying “that’s a fake left-wing fire”.@kcimc @4THEGWORLS @TWOCCNYC @TransHomeSF Thanks for this list  Kyle.

And you can build optimized bundles.@tylerneylon You can use all of those techniques with D3 because it allows direct access to the DOM  but if you’re using d3-transition  typically it involves setting up a requestAnimationFrame loop that repeatedly assigns styles or attributes over the duration of the transition.@MAKIO135 @observablehq Thank you!!

There may be limits to how far it can go without a very large re-architecture.@ericclemmons @ScriptedAlchemy Very interesting! I'm definitely going to dig into this more. I'm not totally sold on doing this at runtime  I suspect that doing it at build time (like WebpackDLL) may have better dev ergonomics and be able to handle server-side rendering better.@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira The way we do it right now (at least for our UI components) is that we can ship multiple versions simultaneously while individual callsites are still being updated (but then eventually re-converging on a single shipped version). For 3rd-party libs it's all-or-nothing.@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira Hmm! I wonder if having independent deploys is mutually exclusive with having shared code? I'd like to hope it's not  but it could be! And maybe that's the issue we're hitting...@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira It seems like the strategies are very focused on letting teams make their own tech decisions - but that doesn't align with what we do. We want a unified central library/toolkit and we want everyone using it (we have that now). Fracturing tools is bad for performance!@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira Very interesting! This seems very focused on separation of concerns  which is good  but it's not clear to me how builds/deploys are working - can the JS services be deployed independently of each other? without having to rebuild everything? how are dependencies shared?@mattwallace Haha  if no one posts an idea then that's what I'll have to research myself! I'm expecting that this is probably what we'll be doing in 2021 or thereabouts  but I want to plan ahead!Khan Academy has 800 000+ lines of JS (not including modules) - no matter how you slice it that's a lot to build either for a deploy or incrementally during development. The smart play seems to break things into smaller chunks (services?) but how do you handle shared code?I haven't seen much written online about doing JS builds that are broken down into ""services"" that can be deployed independently of each other. Most seem to expect you to build the entire universe on every deploy. Webpack DLLs seem like they might get close - thoughts?@mellowbeing @FutureLearn Ahh -- that looks so cool!! Thank you for the link! 😀@astanley711 Your post was beautiful  thank you so much for sharing! (And your site looks great  too!)Did a mini-interview with @HenriHelvetica on the 14th anniversary of the release of jQuery! A great thread with lots of factoids inside 😊 - thank you Henri! https://t.co/48Q6Zyibu3@scottjehl Both of these things! When we do SSR we do (limited) UA detection to serve up different experiences to older browsers (no point in rendering something old browsers can't use). And also it affects what bundles we serve (e.g. do we need to polyfill a certain browser feature?)@mikesherov @slightlylate @DasSurma This definitely breaks server-side rendering and services like https://t.co/lNWevvBD2b - a huge bummer  are they not listening to users/devs?@HenriHelvetica Hehe  DM is fine!

And it has strong cultural ties to PL  the Baltics  Belarus.Here we go  some words of sanity and science just when we need them - from Jim  who's a terrific journalist (and part of my literal extended family  but that only means I've seen him grow into this role at CNN): https://t.co/fRl12h0JXj@saralandrydj @bleepeater I sometimes go through this process *during a single studio session* but hell yes.@gabeastralplane @_frktl --- but it's a topic for its own investigation. I just think some caution is needed as cities get reduced to caricatures  and maybe they're messier than that. The business techno analysis absolutely holds up.@gabeastralplane @_frktl They may be more similar than that comparison would imply. NYC does have a significant amount of public and private funding for arts  albeit not as often granted directly to individuals. Berlin and DE zoning and policy is currently favoring FIRE in a number of ways.@gabeastralplane @_frktl I did once see an enormous painting of Sven hanging in a real estate office in Mitte  so it is at least *conceivable* you're right. ;)@gabeastralplane @_frktl That is  NYC squandered its chance to really invest in culture and science. Berlin - verdict is still out. I also would say *pre*-pandemic (even post to some extent) it's worth looking at artists who moved from a NYC (or for more contrast Detroit) *to* Berlin.@gabeastralplane @_frktl Aha  ok - though FIRE in Berlin is unlike NYC or Lndn  uh  yet. (gulp) It's also unclear to me how much that's ""cool techno"" versus ""this is now the capital of Europe and the seat of government."" Keep in mind Internet tech grew *faster* than tourism/ent in recent yrs.@gabeastralplane @_frktl Definitely - and saving this to read a couple of times over again. I do have to push back a bit on dumping on the capital cities  though - there is also excitement to density  as hubs attract people  across disciplines  no?

And while you're at it  *at least* don't sleep on the great stuff coming from @hueymnemonic ...Essential start to the back-to-school syllabus. It's music  so the syllabus also includes listening. https://t.co/U3wGwA56zuWonderful that some things even just exist. Like if William Blake got a monome and learned Lua... https://t.co/oSnrbxrZck@Chris_Randall Should be pretty easy. Just protest by playing chords. Or in tune. ;)@mypandashallfly @zunaito Also - it's not like I'm begrudging artists who can't afford engineers. These services do have a business model  and it isn't free. Someone is profiting at the expense of actual engineers  and it is possible to teach producers how to master their own stuff and retain control.@zunaito @mypandashallfly Right  but then - they're producing the music on a tool capable of doing the job. The issue is  the cloud stuff takes control out of their hands. It devalues both the producer *and* the mastering engineer.@mypandashallfly @zunaito I'm not questioning artists using automated services. The issue is then  do these tools meet those artists' needs and give them adequate control and output? And they don't. I've tried them.@sinhadeb Well and if they don't you have someone to yell at  too. ;)@aetheric_co Sure. Then again  in 2020  mastering engineers can just ask  ""how did cutting your own hair work out for you? Now you understand.""@piesaac I cured my gout with a combination of hot yoga and Schenkerian analysis  but only after retuning to 432 Hz. It can work for you.@aetheric_co But it is. Locally on your machine you can see how stuff works. Even if it's obfuscated in the plugin - and in most it really is not - you still have the actual signal. So there is a difference  really.Don't trust me  though. I live in a city full of shady leftists who dress in black and embrace let's say a Theremin communist lifestyle.Reason to be afraid - POTUS reveals that Biden is being controlled by Dark Shadows. https://t.co/TxgAxmquy0@aetheric_co But then why not simplified overall loudness controls? Those could work for beginners without overly warping their content.@snikolov Yeah  but they do the opposite. They're designed like black boxes. And the output doesn't really make sense either. Tools from Waves or iZotope or Eventide or built into your DAW have presets that work better than these and tons of educational materials.So yes  I guess since this is coming up again  probably I should get some flame-retardant clothes and we should talk more on @cdmblogs about this.And now  knowing so many talented artists out of work  yeah  this is a social justice issue. Automating away their labor for your VC-backed tech company is not very okay. Not that anyone asked. Wait  I may have just said a bunch of things I believe in public again. Oops.But why would you tell someone who has done something as complicated as making a track with today's insanely-complex DAWs and plug-ins that they ""want"" a Fisher Price-styled end point dumber than most Instagendpointram settings? It doesn't compute.Anyone producing music also is using a ton of sophisticated tools. If they want fast results  they can also just use a plug-in and presets and *still* have more choice than these tools offer - and then they should go back later  turn that s*** off  and hire someone.Some of the people who worked on those products  yeah  I know you know me  but probably you don't want me to write about this. ;) No fault to you trying  I just think it's the wrong approach.I'm not even a mastering engineer  so you can trust me. This. LANDR  SoundCloud automated mastering - look  they don't work. They're anti-human  anti-music  they miss the whole point of what an engineer does. https://t.co/dah2Mw5pTE@drmathys_ Yes  exactly! I should go back and reread this...@drmathys_ That doesn't surprise me at all. And I don't have much hope for the USA in this regard now  either  because 2020 census is a total mess. Been talking to my parents; my mom is working as a census worker.@drmathys_ But you know  now seems like a good moment  right? I see Polish friends protesting anti-Black racism in Warsaw. And people immigrating back from all post-colonial areas to Europe  so the decolonializing conversation now has everyone involved at the table :)@drmathys_ I always thought at least for Latinx-  Arab-  Asian-[USA] Americans  etc.  who can pass in various ways  reclaiming identity could help. But it's complex - generational gaps  mixed-race backgrounds  and you need to still work together *and* recognize privilege.@drmathys_ It's the whole history of the USA  too. It's not just ""assimilation""; it's been a contest to become more white  at the expense of other immigrant groups  and piling even more discrimination and exclusion on Black Americans.Let's see  in stressful times people like comforts so ... why not Live 1 and Live 2 skins as Live 10 themes? ;) https://t.co/Oum4eOrPucHere's your Monday morning moment of contemplation :) https://t.co/fKMpYaE4PM@jaytholen @DoctorLlamaLord Some people just don't appreciate great UX. ;)@poemproducer That's gorgeous  wow! &lt;3@szk_1992 Excellent.

And Trump said he wants to make it permanent  which would affect those programs pretty severely if you ask me.@stanley3smith3 @Improbably11 @SharylAttkisson Both Republican and Democratic Presidents have been racking up the debt for 50 years. There’s equal blame to go around. Trump knew this and still promised that he would eliminate the debt. Not sure what his brilliant plan was  but it definitely had the opposite effect.@SharylAttkisson Trump pledged to abolish the payroll taxes that pay for Medicare and Social Security.

I fully expect to get a new pair before it runs outMy original AirPods have bit  the dust.  The battery only lasts about 30 mins. I have the pros too  but they aren’t as nice if I want to listen to something while falling asleep.

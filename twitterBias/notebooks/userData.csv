I’m chomping at the bit waiting for my CS4 review code.😅@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers Especially in a system like Matt LaFleur’s where it’s hard for a rookie to pick it up.  The best draft pick on the field today might’ve even been Josiah DeGuara.  Nobody called that.@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers Can’t look back at that now. Remember we picked 3 receivers in the draft two years ago. 2 are still on the team. The time to rate that draft is after this year.  They’re not meant to be judged immediately.@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers The Achilles heel aside from the poor run defense?  Aaron Rodgers not playing like the bad man that he is.Even San Francisco folded because of talent deficiency at QB once Mahomes started rolling.@Trev_Arnold @IKE_Packers SF did that to MIN too last year  and they supposedly had a good run defense.Every opponent has to be played differently  and we had a rock solid plan at MIN today. Just go out there and execute. Rodgers will be the first to tell you he didn’t execute in Santa Clara too.😂 https://t.co/AOHUtT98aohttps://t.co/QuDOvzV3gj https://t.co/ZB6cpA7lO0SoFi Stadium looks like an upside down swoosh. I dig it. Love to go to a game or an event there once we’re allowed to.Like how did they get Marshawn to do this commercial when Skittles aren’t involved?I love this chips commercial.Robert Woods. Cooper Kupp.  And now Van Jefferson. Rams doing much more than Dallas’ unheralded offense.@RaffRaff73 Played 12 games. New system. Did next to nothing his rookie year. Consistency. These experts are acting like the Cowboys have had a high-octane passing offense for years.@RaffRaff73 He’s fine. I wanna see a full season of consistency. Further breakout candidate sure.Carrie Underwood is wearing pants so moms can stop complaining about the SNF intro being too sexualized.The only proven receiver Dallas has is Amari Cooper  and I’m sorry to say it  America... he’s not Dak good either.

Intimidated by the know-it-all types in the earlier years  I always assumed it'd be the opposite.@hagmonk The same tricks don't always apply to distributed traces because most language runtimes don't have a canonical context propagation standard and propagating trace in the same process is also tricky. Auto-instrumenting the web/RPC framework is often the best bet.Unless you can't link into your users' frameworks  it's hard to provide out-of-the-box distributed traces as a platform provider. You can start them  participate in them  you may even provide automatic ones for service calls but end-to-end traces require user participation.@fatiher99 Insanlari fakir birakmakla ovunmek boyle bir sey.

Pessoal que vinha atrás se distraiu e acelerou na hora errada. Foram induzidos pelas bandeiras/luzes verdes #F1naGloboPor isso a gente teve relargadas emocionantes em Baku e no GP do Brasil  em Interlagos. Relargadas assim colaboram pro espetáculo. Mas são mais arriscadas #F1naGloboE desde 2018 a relargada é sempre na linha de chegada. Essas confusões acontecem sempre nos circuitos em que a linha de largada é a mesma da chegada. Normalmente  a linha de chegada é antes do grid. Não é o caso de Mugello #F1naGloboE outra coisa: não tem rádio não?

E a confusão foi antes do acidente do Leclerc  no safety causado pelo MagnussenDesisti  na boa. Brigar com os fatos e com as imagens não é a minha. Rs https://t.co/LZuX8RjfGGE por último: a Mercedes e o Hamilton admitiram o erro. Outro detalhe: apenas 2 dos 18 carros ainda na prova naquele momento fizeram a parada irregular. Ou seja: definitivamente o problema não foi a sinalização  não é mesmo?Como eu já disse aqui: os pilotos conseguem sim ver esses painéis. Tanto é que já vimos pilotos depurando rivais por desrespeitar esses painéis. Ultrapassagem em bandeira amarela  por exemplo.Quem pode dizer se a sinalização é boa ou ruim  nesse caso  é só o piloto. E esse sistema de bandeiras + painéis eletrônicos já dura muitos anos na #F1 com muito sucesso.Sobre sinalização de pista na #F1: se os pilotos  que são aqueles que estão acelerando a mais de 300 km/h  não reclamaram e pediram mudança depois do que vimos ontem  não são os especialistas de sofá que vão mudar isso  não é mesmo?Prova de quê? Prova de que ele pode não ter visto. Só isso. E o fato de ele não ter visto não quer dizer que a sinalização é ruim. Simplesmente ele poderia estar prestando atenção em outra coisa. https://t.co/pzszkbsfy5Não é do lado direito  amigo. A tomada da Parabolica é feita pelo lado externo. Tanto que tem sensor de limite de pista ali. O painel fica na direção de onde o piloto enxerga. Pelo lado interno não faz o menor sentido https://t.co/cqi5IlYisgExatamente isso! E a própria Mercedes admitiu o erro. Vou escrever um post com os detalhes que fiquei sabendo depois da corrida  inclusive! https://t.co/4KSbdlOAH2Mas tinha! No último posto de fiscais antes dos boxes. Justamente aquele da curva que a gente vê nas onboards. https://t.co/33sjy4hDFiNão foi sinalizado de forma precária  Rodrigo. Esse X só serve pra avisar box fechado. E além disso foi no último marshalling post (posto de fiscais) antes da entrada do pit lane. Não era longe dos boxes. https://t.co/XxF1Lek8mGComo não? O carro do Magnussen estava sendo empurrado por vários fiscais em direção ao pit lane! https://t.co/JYmxRoRw3eNão deu. Apareceu só a informação de pit entry clear (desobstruída) após o carro do Magnussen ser removido. Apareceu apenas nas telas de informação da cronometragem https://t.co/jT1oWxJ1ymExatamente. Fora que os pilotos já estão acostumados com esse tipo de sinalização. Já vimos reclamações pelo rádio de pilotos dedurando outros que teriam desrespeitado painéis eletrônicos.Mas nesse caso  a culpa foi da equipe por não avisar - ou avisar tarde demais - pelo rádio https://t.co/vHZikxk4I7Aumentando o perigo na entrada dos boxes? Fazendo um ou mais pilotos frearem bruscamente vindo de uma curva a 250km/h? Não é uma solução inteligente. https://t.co/S6OqXcMiO0Perigo é inerente. Perigo desnecessário é outra coisa. https://t.co/NlDrRvmZL2@toso_andre Boa. Quem tem 99% da responsabilidade é o engenheiro nessa. O piloto  vendo o painel  pode até evitar a cagada. Mas definitivamente não é culpa dele@toso_andre Eu acho que a sinalização foi OK. Tô argumentando isso com quem defende a tal luz na entrada do pit.Concordo. Mas é um erro bem amador  convenhamos  não? https://t.co/4rDJ7EBrEs@parreiras_gugu Deram mole  pois.@Giilerme Sim  mas é assim que tudo funciona hoje. O rádio é essencialExatamente! E nesse tipo de caso  é papel do engenheiro informar esse tipo de especificidade. O painel é só a última chance de evitar o problema https://t.co/mXFhwPopdXA questão é essa! Como o Hamilton ia evitar a entrada com essa sinalização sem enfiar o pé no freio (eles saem da Parabolica a mais de 250 km/h) e colocar em risco quem vinha atrás? https://t.co/mwdggHVJ3A@Giilerme Então. Isso foi feito  pela tela de informações da direção de prova que todas as equipes têm nos boxesMemes à parte  um sinal na entrada dos boxes só seria mais perigoso. Primeiro por gerar uma freada brusca. Segundo porque poderíamos ter inúmeros ncidentes ali. E lembrando: os painéis podem não ser visíveis pra gente  menos mortais.

Vou checar@Zagoman Sim  numa bandeira vermelha ocasionada pelo Maldonado. E era permitido!O regulamento da F1 sempre permitiu mexer nos carros em bandeira vermelha  Gilson. O que acontece é que todo mundo sempre faz confusão com a regra do automobilismo americano. https://t.co/HIU9UBGIfGConcordo. E essa já foi uma alteração pra agradar ao público - em bandeiras vermelhas e largadas em pista molhada com o safety car. De repente pode ser uma medida a ser tomada para 2021. https://t.co/8ka4VaVitwRespondendo: hoje eu achei injusta em um primeiro momento. Mas depois  analisando o local do problema  achei justa. Imagina se começa uma sequência normal de pit stops em bandeira verde com o carro do Magnussen sendo socorrido pelos fiscais? Muito arriscado. https://t.co/3dvlMrqIEkA única alteração que eu faria na regra nesses casos seria obrigar não só o uso de dois tipos de pneus mas também um pit stop. Seguiria liberada a troca de pneus na bandeira vermelha  mas ela não contaria na regra  o piloto seguiria obrigado a fazer um pit stop convencional https://t.co/xyidCXl2wJNão vejo problemas na regra. O problema é que ela está sendo questionada pura e simplesmente porque um dos favoritos da galera não foi ao pódio e outro  não tão querido  foi por influência direta dela.Na Nascar  as corridas duram 3h  4h. Na F1  1h30  em média. Então  nos EUA  faz sentido a regra de não mexer no carro  já que existe tempo para se recuperar. Na F1 e nas corridas europeias  não.@manudinho Eu tô sendo extremo pra questionar o comentário dele. Ele disse que seria uma dobradinha da McLaren se nada acontecesse. Eu corrigi: seria vitória do HamiltonPor que existe a regra da bandeira vermelha? Simples: para não prejudicar um piloto que nada teve a ver com o acidente e pegou destroços na pista  danificando seu carro.Outra coisa: a dinâmica das corridas de F1 é bem diferente das da Nascar  por exemplo  a começar pelo tempo.@Gilsonp Exatamente isso!Essa é a questão. Não acho injusta. Acharia injusto se um piloto tivesse pego um destroço do carro do Leclerc e não pudesse trocar a asa dianteira  por exemplo. E pneu faz parte: imagina se um destroço fura o pneu de alguém? Não vejo problemas na regra da bandeira vermelha. https://t.co/Yvnt7G3faX@Gu_Duran Eles tinham acabado de fazer a parada  não fazia sentido. E acho que poucos tinham pneus novos à disposição àquela altura.@LuucasLT7 Como eu disse  outro piloto na posição dele teria vencido a prova. Mas ele teve mérito de se colocar na situação de ganhar uma vaga no pódio também.Se não acontece nada  o Hamilton teria conquistado a 90ª vitória. https://t.co/DbYA9g1A5v@matheusoares_72 Paciência. É assim que o automobilismo funciona.@matheusoares_72 Sim. Mérito dele e da equipe por adiar a parada. Rs@LuucasLT7 Ele pode até não merecer por "n" motivos. Sei lá eu.Mas usar uma regra que sempre esteve no regulamento para desmerecer é demais pra mim.É assim que funciona no automobilismo e na Fórmula 1. O regulamento está lá para ser usado. E a troca de pneus na bandeira vermelha é permitida. Então... Parabéns à Racing Point e ao Lance Stroll.A Racing Point e o Lance Stroll se usaram do regulamento hoje em uma grande manobra estratégica e também de sorte. Parabéns para eles. O canadense mereceu o pódio.Todo mundo sabe que sou um crítico do Lance Stroll. Mas minimizar o pódio dele hoje por causa da regra da bandeira vermelha é maldade.Até acho que outro piloto na posição dele teria ganhado a corrida hoje - ele cometeu dois erros bobos após a segunda largada. https://t.co/yrpUzOrif8Sempre foi assim. Em algumas bandeiras vermelhas na F1 antiga  até se trocava de carro  quando o regulamento permitia.Podemos discutir a regra. Mas ignorar que SEMPRE foi assim na F1 não é legal. #F1naGloboE mais um adendo: a regra da bandeira vermelha  no automobilismo europeu  sempre foi essa: salvo algumas restrições  as equipes sempre puderam mexer nos carros. É um conceito diferente do automobilismo americano  onde não se pode tocar nos carros em bandeira vermelha #F1naGlobo@saqueevoleio Eita...@eduardocanuto Sim.

Nos anos 1980 tinha a cabine do ponto de ônibus no gramado!No traçado antigo  as corridas tinham em torno de 36 voltas (pouco mais de 500 km). Depois passaram a ter 28 (394 km). Agora têm 44 voltas no traçado de 7.004 metros (308 052 km).Aqui as fotos da velha e da nova Bus Stop de Spa-Francorchamps: https://t.co/n6j8ydt9elDepois  só pequenas mudanças. O autódromo foi fechado  já que antes usava estradas da região. Mudaram as áreas de escape das curvas Eau Rouge  Raidillon e Blanchimont e  claro  a Bus Stop  que deixou de contornar o ponto de ônibus para virar uma chicane direita-esquerda normal.Spa-Francorchamps ao longo do tempo:Antes da grande mudança de 1978  o traçado tinha 15 quilômetros.

Pisar no freio de forma acintosa #F1noSporTV https://t.co/J6ZhowRZd2Ele não pode ir deliberadamente para a frente de outro piloto e meter o pé no freio. #F1noSporTV https://t.co/ZuweWqZtm2@ScuderiaMilani @mtilhe @MarceloCourrege Sim.

Rs@FernandoSVboas Como eu disse  mais ou menos. Tem muita política por trás disso aí.@djdupedroso @arielmartins25 @marvin3840 Por enquanto  pelo menos. Rs@arielmartins25 @marvin3840 Os caras são bons. Rs@djdupedroso @arielmartins25 @marvin3840 O modo festa é legal  pelo regulamento. RsEstima-se que o motor Mercedes desenvolva mais de 1.000 cv no modo festa nas classificações #F1naGlobo #F1noSporTV #F1noGE@arielmartins25 @marvin3840 Mas o scenario 7 não é o modo festa. Rs. Ali na Áustria foi um conjunto do modo com mais potência disponível para a CORRIDA com pneus mais novos. Os motores Mercedes tem um modo de ainda mais potência que so vale pro quali@sigahobohemians Segue assim. É uma decisão política  claro.@mvessaro8 Sim  se a Williams estiver usando o modo festa. Geralmente as clientes usam menos por questão de custos. Aumenta o risco de quebra porque o motor é mais exigido também. E quebra significa gasto.@pbernardoc Não. Os mesmos do GP da Inglaterra. Que deram problema no fim. Rs@mvessaro8 Acho que é muito mais político que técnico. Curioso para saber as consequências disso nas relações da #F1.No lado técnico  pode ser interessante. Mas a Mercedes vai continuar com a vantagem em volta lançada. Ainda que um pouco menor.@pbernardoc Mas também acho que a Mercedes vai vir mordida depois de perder em Silverstone. Rs@pbernardoc É um circuito exigente pros pneus e com previsão de temperatura alta. Pode dar certo sim pra Red BullAinda no giro político da #F1... a FIA quer vetar o modo festa dos motores na classificação a partir do GP da Bélgica. Isso  aquele modo que dá mais potência para o motor em uma volta lançada que a Mercedes tem excelência #F1naGlobo #F1noSporTV #F1noGE@ceni2005 @everaldomarques @LucianoBurti @SporTV @RedeGlobo @MarceloCourrege Depende da escala.

E o brilho de Verstappen na pista não aconteceria sem uma boa estratégia. #F1naGloboE hoje aquela máxima tem de ser repetida: o automobilismo é o esporte individual mais coletivo que existe.Grande trabalho de Max Verstappen. Grande trabalho da Red Bull.#F1naGloboE para ganhar da Mercedes atualmente  a equipe precisa fazer um trabalho muito bem feito e contar com um desempenho espetacular do piloto na pista. Foi exatamente o que aconteceu com a Red Bull no GP dos 70 anos da #F1Como já escrevi aqui: desempenho do Verstappen na pista foi espetacular. Mas não dá pra negar que a estratégia foi perfeita. Desde o Q2 no qualifying  aliás. https://t.co/9wRLUHvNBg@Vandoolive94 @abnerrrrrrrrr Já! GP da Espanha em BarcelonaSe não me engano  quem recebeu o troféu pela Red Bull foi o chefe administrativo Jonathan Wheatley #F1naGloboE só pra falar  pensando em campeonato  foi uma inversão bem plausível. Até porque o Hulk pode estar fora da equipe já na próxima corrida  enquanto o Lance Stroll vai ficar até o fim do ano #F1naGlobo https://t.co/JSL7wXjgYzPrimeira vitória do Max Verstappen em Silverstone. E sempre destaque para o time de estratégia da Red Bull  comandado pela estrategista Hannah Schmitz. Uma vitória de equipe. E que começou no Q2 do qualifying #F1naGloboE a Racing Point que chamou o Hulkenberg pra uma parada extra só pro Stroll chegar na frente... #F1naGloboMax Verstappen vence! Que corrida do holandês! E que estratégia da Red Bull! Trabalho conjunto e exemplar! Corridaça! #F1naGloboE mais uma corrida apática do Bottas #F1naGlobo@drtuliofonseca @LucianoBurti @giaffonef Mas não duram nada no carro da MercedesMercedes brigam? Verstappen agradece #F1naGloboVerstappen parece ter desempenho bom ainda nesses pneus... #F1naGlobo"Valtteri  it's James"? #F1naGlobo@brunobergamo Novinho.Se seguir a lógica do primeiro stint  o Hamilton vai ter algumas voltas rápidas no início do pneu  mas vai perder rendimento em breve #F1naGlobo@MariaPCA1 É meio automático  porque é um sensor. Ficar de olho. Se não aparecer nada é porque não excedeuHamilton travou tudo na entrada dos boxes. Ficar de olho se ele não excedeu o limite de velocidade #F1naGloboVerstappen VOANDO! #F1naGlobo@psipsi98 Acho que os amarelos. Vermelhos seriam uma surpresaOs pneus traseiros do Hamilton estão em frangalhos já #F1naGloboHannah Schmitz é a engenheira responsável pela estratégia do Verstappen.

Aliás  desde o qualifying #F1naGloboEsquece. Hamilton vai ter de parar #F1naGloboMuito bem a Red Bull pra neutralizar a estratégia da Mercedes! #F1naGloboVerstappen e Bottas no box! Agora o Hamilton vai se arrastar até o fim? #F1naGloboPneus das Mercedes já foram embora... desempenho espetacular da Red Bull e de Verstappen hoje #F1naGloboRicciardo rodou... #F1naGloboVerstappen deu 26 voltas com o duro. Quantas voltas vão conseguir dar as Mercedes? #F1naGloboAgora o Hamilton insinuando que os pneus da Red Bull do Verstappen estão com pressão mais baixa... #F1naGlobo@MariaPCA1 Ganhou no box do Hamilton. Rs. Já twittei depois. RsAté agora um trabalho conjunto brilhante de Red Bull e Verstappen em Silverstone #F1naGloboVerstappen na frente! Sensacional a estratégia da Red Bull e desempenho absurdo do Verstappen na pista! #F1naGloboVerstappen de médios! E ganhou a posição do Hamilton! Olha!!! #F1naGloboChegou! #F1naGloboRed Bull pediu pro Max forçar o ritmo. Momento da parada chegando! #F1naGloboMuito bom primeiro stint do Max. Muito bom mesmo. Aumentando a vantagem e os pneus seguem parecendo estar em bom estado #F1naGloboJá tem bolhas nos pneus de Hamilton e Bottas. Olha o pulo do gato da Red Bull #F1naGloboSe o Verstappen conseguir manter esse ritmo... o carro da Red Bull tá tratando melhor os pneus que o da Mercedes... será? #F1naGloboVerstappen tá mantendo muito bem o desempenho na frente. Vantagem pro Bottas estabilizou em 13 segundos já #F1naGlobo@humanuserbot Pneus mais macios e calor mais forte.Vettel tá remando e se recuperando. Já esta em 11° #F1naGloboAgora é ficar de olho na tática do Max. Acho que ele vai de duro-duro... talvez um macio no fim. A ver #F1naGloboO Hamilton ganha terreno no complexo da Maggots-Becketts-Chapel. Mas o Verstappen tem pista livre agora. É acelerar pra fazer um bom trecho até a parada #F1naGloboTá bem boa essa corrida. Cheia de alternativas #F1naGloboO Verstappen tem duas opções: ou fica a um segundo do Hamilton para evitar a turbulência ou parte pra um ataque rápido. Se não atacar  os duros dele vão embora #F1naGloboE tome erro do Albon também. Tudo bem que ele não tem o mesmo carro do Verstappen  mas a pressão tá fazendo mal demais a ele #F1naGlobo@EddyFerndz O oficial da F1Olho no Verstappen. Esse primeiro trecho de duros vai ser decisivo pras pretensões dele na corrida #F1naGloboGosto do Vettel  o carro da Ferrari é uma porcaria  a equipe tá andando pra ele... mas hoje foi um erro até primário do alemão. Não foi culpa da equipe italiana #F1naGloboBottas se manteve à frente.

>11493602.0,Is this image... 1. A Hermann grid illusion from my HCI classor 2. An instructor's view of their students on Zoom after 4 weeks of classes. https://t.co/WwTGXOFF1uSo I think it's a reasonable assumption that many PUIs which were approved to hire a CS faculty member last year would be looking to hire again this year under normal circumstances.Since we're all under heavy financial constraints  seeing who *can* hire is interesting.For those not in CS who follow me  you should know that CS currently lives in an academia bizarro world in which most PUIs desperately need faculty and often fail searches (https://t.co/7mS7D62ZOo).1.5 weeks later  each point in this thread is only amplified. Ads compared to last year are sloooooooow. That's not surprising  but I gotta say  the unpredictability of *who* can still hire leaves me a bit baffled. Zero correlation with resources/rankings. https://t.co/XJtgGWgfHgA silver lining to constantly creating videos is that I'm more comfortably constantly creating videos. Why did I ever give design feedback in my HCI course any other way? Walking through and annotating @AdobeXD prototypes via @loom &gt;&gt;&gt; bullet point text feedback.This project looks fantastic. Congratulations @crystaljjlee! https://t.co/8y6z7oVMs4It's an overwhelming semester  but please don't forget to nominate undergraduates who deserve to be awarded for their research. https://t.co/ILT1V3Ms7k@ngehlenborg Nah  MIT is in SVG-tier.So I understand how prestige bias can influence me on a hiring committee  but what's the bias called where I think less of a university because when I zoom in on their webpage  the logo is so low-def that I can tell it's pixelated even when I return to normal zoom levels?I'm happy to see more universities drop these exams as a requirement. https://t.co/v6Lz39vbU1@affectivecogntn @havillj Not just those skills. In HCI (my field)  taking psych or sociology would very likely set you up for success more than an additional physics or math or computer theory course. If your courses align with your program  it's better. I don't like making BS/BA distinctions.We address this explicitly in CS orientations  and I've gotten into a habit of directly poking the topic when I bring in alumni panels  but I would like to improve the messaging *before students arrive on campus*CS alum I talk to never regret the BA because it gave them flexibility to explore other topics that often empower their current careers. But my students often feel shame and pressure about switching from BS to BA.Part of my motivation is seeing if departments are crafting good public-facing resources that undermine the implicit hierarchy that many students seem to internalize that BA is *less than* BS.@djp3 I think this happens a lot on a personal advising level  but I'm curious what kind of public-facing resources departments have.@AllenDowney Are you saying that offering both a BA and BS might suggest a failure to reach consensus on departmental objectives?I want to make sure I'm following.Question for those in CS depts that offer both BA and BS degrees. I ran across a university this morning that had really terrible guidance on why students should choose one or the other. I have my own take on this  but I'm curious what guidance you provide students.This is still the most personally meaningful project I've been part of. Thanks @Data_Soul! https://t.co/fF9hBFZwjDVery happy to see a vis paper on this topic. Articulating the goals of public visualizations in a more principled way is a critical step to making the right design decisions. https://t.co/t12Wwpv8WrOur context: - Bucknell has 3000+ students on campus (&gt; 90%). Many profs are teaching in-person.- We've had a very slow trickle of COVID-19 cases (13 in total)  but no spikes yet. So ...  this could be the best it's going to get this semester.3. Keeping universities afloat right now demands *so much* extra time and attention this semester. Popular tweets are like "Educators  take must the weekend off! You deserve it!" I agree... but the tradeoff isn't some abstract committee  it's my students.Like many schools  Bucknell eliminated mid-semester breaks so we can send students home for the semester at Thanksgiving. I thought it was a great decision to prevent COVID  but students desperately needed that break to regroup and rest during the best of times. Now what?2. I'm pretty concerned about students over the course of the semester. I've seen energy and enthusiasm degrade over 3 weeks at about twice the speed of a normal semester. This whole experience is exhausting for everyone  and we have to do it for 11 (?!) more weeks.(1 continued..)I will never mandate cameras on + I'm happy they are seeing each other... but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't on a little demoralizing on my end. The good news is that I can still see that 90% of the class is engaged via frequent clicker questions.Bucknell is now 20% through the semester. 3 early observations from 3+ weeks of remote lecturing: I do lots of activities in Zoom break-out rooms. I'm noticing students are starting to turn off their camera when we're all together  but put them on during smaller interactions.Two follow-up thoughts: - I hate making errors  but I'm very comfortable with laughing at my mistakes and not getting derailed during class. - These moments always remind me of how often I'm afforded the benefit of the doubt by students in ways that other  colleagues are not@jdcshaverford @martyjwolf Somehow  I've included a "None above" or "I'm not sure" in every clicker question during the 3 weeks *before* this lecture.  Fortunately  these are no-stakes assessments (anonymous  for in-class reflection on comprehension)I managed to create 2 different clicker questions for CS 1 students today in which the correct answer wasn't *any* of the options on the screen. At least my lectures aren't recorded and preserved on the internet forever this semester  right?

>11615212.0,Great thing about Twitter as opposed to FB is no one fuckin cares! (Flip side: no bad advice)I am so disappointed in people but mostly in myself. I’ve been making difficult things work for a long time but I’m out of cognitive and emotional resources. At the worst possible time.*compromised*illThe best one I got was “check out Queer Exchange”  which is a Facebook group I started when I wasn’t as I’ll  back in 2011 or so. There are local versions all over the place now. I’m now too old and too disabled to be very valuable in those spaces.I know personal connections are hard to come by and it’s not that I think people are holding out on me. Times are hard  and even in my comprised state I have relative privilege. What I don’t understand is advice like “check out Craigslist”.The problem is not that I don’t have the imagination or Google skills to identify “cute queer towns”. The problem is I don’t have the income and credit and etc to qualify to rent from randos. I need personal connections.A recurring one is “You should check out Northampton”. I am a 40-something queer person  loosely lesbian-affiliated. You’ll be shocked to know I have indeed heard of Northampton!I can barely put words together but I’ve been using all of my energy for 6 months trying to claw back my tenuous connections  see if anyone knows anyone or anything. I get a lot of clueless advice.I have been trying in earnest since about April (was trying half-heartedly before then) to organize a life I can afford on disability income. It means leaving the city  both because I think nature might help and because I couldn’t afford it before &amp; really can’t now.I have been depressed for so long that stay-at-home orders hardly phased me. What was different is I had so few connections left because I’d been staying home and people had already forgotten I existed.

When they first opened in 1951  it was vaguely Mexican-themed interiors  though with standard American steakhouse menus. https://t.co/PPi4mxMRlM@mrgan Whoa  just found this ad from April 1  1953. For four years before it became the Pizza Jungle  that location was a Chinese restaurant with the confusing name of "Mayan Jungle." I bet it was the same owners  pivoting to pizza as a last-ditch effort to save the restaurant. https://t.co/z0X7MkdwvA@mrgan This is incredible! Sadly  looks like it only lasted a few months. They opened in February 1957 and their last Oregonian ad was in May.

Tory MPs were looking extremely glum.How serious is the shortage of coronavirus tests? asks Robert Peston | ITV News https://t.co/Aj1gHXCwbTrising  there may well be inadequate capacity for the rest of the population for weeks and months  unless @BorisJohnson’s derided “moonshot” of exponential expansion based on new technologies actually works.PS I understand that 100 000 tests are being delivered to social care settings every day. So that is two-fifths of all testing capacity being absorbed to protect the elderly and vulnerable. Which most people would say makes sense. But it means that with infections...you will have to be patient. But as I said last week  this shortage of tests may lead schools and other institutions to shut temporarily if too many teachers and other staff are off work not really knowing if they are properly ill or not. This testing shortage is a big problem.“but I think that’s right as that’s where the biggest risk is. We see a lot of people coming forward for testing who don’t have symptoms and just like every other bit of the NHS if we don’t manage that demand there is a problem”. Or to put it another way  if you want a test...“even once we have doubled that testing capacity (which we will do by end Oct) we will still have the problem you describe.

But is nonetheless saying he has made a mistakedo or do not come to pass.  And of course the bigger picture is that we are in a vital negotiation to get a deal with the EU.  I think all of this needs to seen in that context. And that’s why I have said relatively little about this issue“. So Cameron is...“last thing you contemplate  an absolute last resort.  So I have grave misgivings about what is being proposed. But let’s be clear about what is happening. The govt has proposed a law that it might or might not act on depending on whether certain circumstances....@David_Cameron has just said this about @BorisJohnson’s decision to legislate and break the international treaty that is the Brexit Withdrawal  Agreement:  “Passing an act of parliament and going on to break an international treaty obligation should be the very...“No British minister should solemnly undertake to observe treaty obligations with his fingers crossed behind his back”. @BorisJohnson’s previous attorney general @Geoffrey_Cox is merciless in his contempt for the PM’s attempt to renege on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.I thought ⁦@hugorifkind⁩‘s “Boris - My Week” would be the funniest thing I would read today.

You can read a bit more about all this here  if you fancy: https://t.co/rfYZMjPZqp (2/2)@equinns The thing is  quite a few councils don't have the right systems to be able to recycle Tetrapak. With a little bit of virgin plastic in there  bottles can be recycled ~10 times  and then go on to live another life as something like a pipe  a park bench  or a pavement. (1/2)@equinns That's a good question  Sarah. Cartons are actually a lot trickier to recycle than plastic  since they're made from lots of different materials.

Really sorry if it’s put you off  but hope it reassures you to know it’s totally safe to drink.@TravellingBigfo it’s best to stick to one portion of our drinks a day (150ml)  a couple bottles would mean you’re well over your daily recommended allowance of fruit. Sorry for getting all fun police on you there.@TravellingBigfo Hello Patrick  really sorry to see that’s happened. When you have a moment please pop these photos over to hello@innocentdrinks.co.uk and we’ll do our best to look into it. Well done on eating a balanced diet  good stuff. We wouldn’t be responsible adults if we didn’t mention@Sarah94x Happy birthday Sarah. Your mum sounds like an absolute legend  which naturally makes you one too.@MarkHaldor Hello Mark  really sorry to hear that. We’ve switched to using Fair Trade coconuts which we think have a lighter  more refreshing taste. Gutted you’re not enjoying it anymore though  we’ll be sure to pass on your feedback to the team. Thanks.@RitterBLN Hallo Michael. Danke für Dein Feedback. Wir teilen das gerne mit unserem Sales-Team und werden darüber diskutieren.

Our drinks count as one of your five a day  and we'd always recommend sticking to a 150ml portion (we mention it on our labels too). Cheers.@bluebeariscool1 @ocramc Well it's fairly warm. But it's not the warmest. 2020 let's us down again. Even more pressure on 2021.@KiddoXIX We're a lucky bunch.@NiciIvi Two years on and your still have impeccable taste  Nicole.@angus_thody can be recycled back into high-quality products like our bottles about ten times. After that  it can still be recycled into lower-grade plastic  which is used for things like solar panels. Hope that helps explain it a bit more.@angus_thody That's a good suggestion  and something we've thought about in the past. From a sustainability perspective though  plastic is easier and more widely recycled than cartons and paper  making it better for a circular economy. For example  PET (the plastic our bottles are made from) @FoxxyFN Hello  really gutted to hear you weren't a fan of this one. Hopefully it's just a taste preference  but just so we can make sure nothing was wrong with your drink  can you pop over a DM when you have a moment? Cheers. https://t.co/ZbDiEfm3c7@SharonSpark A match made in heaven.@DaytonaMills message us your address when you have a mo  and we'll get right to it. Cheers. (2/2)@DaytonaMills Really sorry to hear it wasn't budging  Daytona. We're working on a natural fix to stop any separation  but in the meantime we promise it's totally safe  if pretty unpleasant to look at. We'd love to make up for the drink you had to bin with a different recipe on us. Just (1/2)@DaytonaMills @Tesco Hello Daytona. To reassure you  that's actually the green spirulina extract in this recipe. It's a powder  so it has a tendency to settle a bit  and a really good shake should sort it right out. We know it's not that nice to look at  though  so we're sorry for the shock.@bluebeariscool1 @ocramc WE GOT OVEREXCITED AGAIN. THIS COULD STILL BE OUR YEAR. Talk tomorrow.@bluebeariscool1 @ocramc Apparently this year it's the 31st. NEXT YEAR'S OUR YEAR.@angus_thody Meanwhile we're working hard with government to improve recycling habits in this country  so all our bottles go on to live another life. You can read more about all that here  if you fancy: https://t.co/rfYZMjPZqp. Really hope that reassures how important this is to us too. (2/2)@angus_thody Hello Angus. Cheers for sharing your thoughts about this.  We've been looking into it for over 20 years  and we're confident plastic's the most sustainable option for our bottles. We started using rPET back in 2003  and we're on track to a 100% renewable bottle by 2022. (1/2)@Ian_Farrar That's a good question  Ian. We've switched to a Fair Trade coconut variety  the Laguna Tall from the Philippines. It's a maturer coconut compared to the green varieties we were using before  and should have a fresher  cleaner taste. Hope that explains things a bit more.@monmontweets We've come over all nostalgic  Monelle. Thanks for sharing that - we'll let the people in charge of fun stuff know you're keen for another one.@TriSarahTopsTLH Pencil shavings and floor polish? Something's gone horribly wrong.@rosy_lyon Hello Rosy. The Big Knit's very much on  and thanks to nice knitters and crocheters like you we've already received thousands of bobble dazzlers.

If you send us a DM with your post code and the recipe you’re after  we’ll let you where you’re most likely to find it in your neck of the woods.

Happy travels.@ProperGirly @AgeUKSuffolk Consider it done  Nikki. Let's give this lot the send off they deserve (and thanks for getting your needles out to support the Big Knit).@ProperGirly @AgeUKSuffolk £200k recently to keep their services running during lockdown. We'll always help however we can  so it pains us to say there's not much more we can do right now. If you have any ideas please do let us know  even if it's just sending drinks to staff and the people they help. (2/2)@ProperGirly @AgeUKSuffolk That really is awful news  Nikki.

Thanks for keeping us on our toes about the important stuff.@TheGreatE3cape Hello there. We're sorry to be the bearers of bad news  but we're afraid we stopped making that recipe a little while ago. We were fans of it too  but not many others were (madness  we know). We really hope those other tasty treats made up for the disappointment. Have a top day.@JoshKovoor We thought we already were  Josh.@clarenich70 crops. We've also kicked off a project to tackle and improve the environmental challenges of almond farming - we know it's not a quick fix  but we're working on it. Really hope that puts your minds at ease. (2/2)@clarenich70 Hello Clare. It's good to know you're thinking about the bee colonies  and we hope it reassures you to know we are too.

We're not sure what happened there  but a happy belated birthday nonetheless. Have a top week.@littlemxssnisha Still care.@SamanthaSiddal3 Hello Samantha. Sorry you got a bit of a shock  but to reassure you  that's actually the green spirulina extract in this recipe. It's a powder so it has a tendency to settle a bit  but a really good shake should sort that right out. Really hope that puts your mind at ease.@valstones @anneharnan Good to see him going strong  Val. Almost as strong as your baking.@YouGetItRight there. Using plastic keeps our bottles in the circular economy  and reduces our carbon emissions compared to something like glass which is a lot heavier. We’re still working on being better  but we really hope that reassures you this stuff's incredibly important to us  too. (2/2)@YouGetItRight We totally agree recycling needs to improve  and we're working hard to improve the way we do things.

Which  genius or terrible  is frankly just a fact.@Later_katers Sorry to give you a shock Kate  but to reassure you  you're spot on. That's the green spirulina extract settling  and a really good shake (the bottle  not you) should sort it right out. Hope that puts your mind at ease so you can enjoy your juice.@3KeelLLP Best news we've had all week. Congratulations  you lot.@YouGetItRight are fully recyclable  and we're working with the government to make sure they all go on to live another life.

The new variety's also Fair Trade  meaning they’re even more sustainable now  and the coconut farmers who we work with are getting something extra to make their lives a little better. Hope that explains things a bit more. (2/2)@Ghoul_of_London Hello there. That's a good question. We used to use coconuts from different varieties  but we’re now using just one  more mature variety (Laguna Tall from the Philippines).

We can totally understanding how off putting green stuff in your juice can be  but to reassure you  that's actually green spirulina extract. It's one of the ingredients that tends to settle  and a good shake should sort it right out. Really hope that helps.@breath_earth Hello Anna.

The #COVID19 pandemic has levied a terrible cost on humanity. These have been hard-won lessons. We must learn from them. And we must build back better"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder"When it comes to preparedness  our biggest obstacle is ourselves. Short-term self-interest is simply not sufficient. It is a basic principle of public health: no individual alone can protect themselves from an outbreak  &amp; no nation can act alone in a pandemic"-@DrTedros"We do not know what the next health emergency will be  but we know it will come. And we must be prepared.  It is the same reason we mandate seatbelts  invest in fire departments  and vaccinate our children"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder"Every day that we stand by and do nothing is a day that brings us closer to the next global health emergency  whether from a disease outbreak  #climatechange  or a natural or self-inflicted disaster"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder"#COVID19 will not be the last pandemic  nor the last global health emergency.  But with the right political and financial investments now  we can prevent and mitigate future pandemics and protect our future and the future of generations to come"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder"We can no longer wring our hands and say something must be done. It’s time for countries to get their hands dirty and build the public health systems to ensure a pandemic of this magnitude and severity never happens again"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder https://t.co/OShhzy6upf"But many of the countries that have done well are those that have learned from previous outbreaks like SARS  MERS  H1N1  Ebola &amp; others. That “muscle memory” has prepared them for this pandemic.Now the whole world must develop the same muscle memory"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder"The #COVID19 pandemic has taken a huge toll on lives &amp; livelihoods  disrupting health systems  economies &amp; societies. Even countries with advanced health systems &amp; powerful economies have been overwhelmed"-@DrTedros #AWorldInDisorder"Let me say it as clearly as I can:we have to work together  plan for the long term &amp; realize that spending on health &amp; preparedness is not charity  it’s an investment in our future.Govts &amp; intl agencies must be accountable to the populations we have pledged to serve"-@DrTedros"We've had many reviews  reports &amp; recommendations.

Also: what’s so great about friendship? https://t.co/SYjQzhbuSNHow is risk different with teachers vs. football players? “You’re not going to deteriorate as a teacher and not be able to get paid going forward. But one year as a football player — there’s a whole other crop of rookies coming in to take your job.” — @Foxworth24To all those worried that the pandemic stalled their Netflix shows…“The Crown is coming this winter.” — @reedhastings: https://t.co/znbZquVR00The NFL has been criticized when addressing players’ medical issues. Is that changing? “I asked that of everyone I talked to  including the commissioner: do we want to really be leaders in sports medicine? And he said yes.” — @NFL doc Allen Sills https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBb“This book is all the things I wish I knew when I started that first company and about the importance of being direct and honest in a professional setting.” — @reedhastings on his new book co-written by @ErinMeyerINSEAD. https://t.co/znbZquVR00“You want to be right up to that edge where it's dynamic and there's freedom. It has not fallen into chaos  but it's right on the edge of it.” — @reedhastings on his business strategy of leading by context: https://t.co/znbZquVR00What are some of the key rules of having no rules? 1. Hire the best people (but no brilliant jerks).  2. Empower them. https://t.co/znbZquVR00Some NFL team owners are thinking of allowing fans at games at 25% capacity. Dr. Thom Mayer from the @NFLPA — “We’re not against it. We just want to make sure that it’s done very carefully and in a way where they don’t come in contact with the players.” https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBb“Just looking at Netflix's overall trajectory  what role do you ascribe to luck?” — @mkonnikova.“Oh  huge.” — @reedhastings: https://t.co/znbZquVR00The @NFL has a seemingly successful Covid-19 containment practice in place. So why can’t this be used in other institutions…like schools? https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBbWhat got Netflix co-CEO @reedhastings to fall in love with business? Vacuum cleaners. This week on Freakonomics Radio Book Club: https://t.co/znbZquVR00What happens if an @NFL player has a positive Covid-19 test? Isolation and contact tracing. But how do you conduct contact tracing on an entire sports league? Tune in to this week’s Freakonomics Radio to find out: https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBbOnce upon a time  Netflix was a DVD shipping and receiving business. Then it became a streaming maverick. Listen to @mkonnikova and @reedhastings talk about Netflix’s rise and Hastings’s new book  in this special episode of Freakonomics Radio Book Club: https://t.co/znbZquVR00Playing football may be an especially potent way to spread Covid-19. BUT @NFL players are used to risk. “You don’t get to the highest level of football without being comfortable acting against your own self interest.” — @Foxworth24 https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBbSURPRISE: Freakonomics Radio Book Club is back! And this time  @mkonnikova is in the host’s chair. Listen to her conversation with Netflix co-CEO @reedhastings about his new book co-authored by @ErinMeyerINSEAD: https://t.co/znbZquVR00Police shootings of Black people triggered protests in the sports world — @NFL players included. “That’s been incredibly encouraging...the empathy that professional athletes have and the civic responsibility that they have.” — @Foxworth24 https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBbNetflix co-founder @reedhastings came to believe that corporate rules can kill creativity. On Freakonomics Radio Book Club  @mkonnikova talks to Hastings about his new book and why for some companies the greatest risk is taking no risks at all. https://t.co/znbZquVR00No bubble  no problem.

This bonus episode of Freakonomics Radio Book Club: https://t.co/znbZquVR00“It’s a coin flip of devastation.” — former NFL player @Foxworth24 on the forces that could bring this year’s @NFL season to an end. This week on Freakonomics Radio: https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBbFootball is a potent opportunity for Covid-19 transmission. So how did the @NFL get ready for this year’s season? https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBbA false-positive Covid-19 scare threatened to derail the 2020 @NFL season. But what would it take to actually cancel it?

It’s scenario planning for the worst-case disaster.” https://t.co/kZOfvNmdWm.@NFL is testing its players every day. Meanwhile some teachers were considering a strike since they weren’t comfortable with the lack of testing. Why has the NFL had so much less friction with its labor force? This week on Freakonomics Radio: https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBb“I know what most football players make  and it’s the equivalent of a teacher’s entire lifetime earnings.” — @Foxworth24  former president of the @NFLPA  on the powerful incentives to get back on the field.

Listen to this week’s new Freakonomics Radio episode here: https://t.co/FEHrzfQlBb“We live in the hyphen between the year that we were born and the year we die.

But I think where the tipping points are have changed wildly and mental models aren’t keeping up@sarahdrinkwater Definitely. I think also the thesis that undivided attention leads to change is no longer true at all either.This feels useful to reflect on because this line has been used by EVERYONE  for causes I agree with and don’t. It casts your group as the underdogs and is never refutable because undivided attention is impossible these days; a parallel is TikTokers claiming they’re shadowbannedthe overarching thing to dig into here is the obsession with getting “people” to care more in our current reality of fractured feeds and attention. how much is sufficiently “more”? what do we imagine that care translating into? what does withheld attention insinuate? https://t.co/V5vqAO1pzj@jettfu @doougle Great to hear  Jett!

We STILL have power... it’s in the everyday choices we make and in the actions we take.We enact it ourselves  every time we overcome the urge to ignore an injustice that is playing out before us  and make the selfless decision to put our personal comfort at risk to right the imbalance.We see it in the way Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has wielded her voice  to hold others in positions of power accountable to their responsibility to do right by their fellow citizens.We saw Muriel Bowser use the power she holds as a city mayor to paint a mural and rename a street.A simple  but POWERFUL act.It can be as simple  as using the resources we have... to help another person in our community achieve success... or simply survive another day.I’ve been thinking a LOT about the systems that perpetuate inequality.We are fed lies that we as individuals do not have power. That our votes  voices  lives don’t matter. But we do. And they do. And we can use them to make meaningful &amp; lasting change in this current world.@saronyitbarek Glasses are my new “make up”.@HenriHelvetica No  no  no.

Hopefully I can find a schematic or HQ teardown :)@RebelbotJen Nothing to be embarrassed about!! That's a really interesting problem and glad you shared  I'll try to see how it's wired up on '16. It's been demonstrated on older models the firmware can be rewritten and LED turned off so curious how yours operates https://t.co/P6fCfqsBPQ@RebelbotJen What model camera or computer? It is possible to turn some cameras on without the LED (eg by lower level API or writing over firmware) but Zoom itself doesn't control the LED  it only engages the camera. Does the LED still work? I'd guess it's broken or camera firmware bug@RueNahcMohr I love hex heads! So much surface area to interface  no slipping  and no stripping  relative to Phillips or flatheads.

There are a dozen or so full voting members  and some other half voting ones  etc. You only need membership for one year to get it through  etc.@oneandonlyjoyce 🦚 ‼️@meidlin @benpasternak I mean  it’s like 4-5 hours of a competent persons time to write a proposal.  Unicode ignores petitions  full stop. So time setting up and promoting a petition is more effectively spent WRITING an actual proposal.This tattoo says General Tso’s Chicken. Would have loved this for @GeneralTsoMovie  @iancheney! https://t.co/DyP3hg0yw4Congrats congrats to @MelissaTherms of @emojination! Driving author of BLOOD DROP emoji  SARI emoji  coauthor of interskintone couple proposal and more to come! (🤞🏽 DOSA and FUFU). https://t.co/uVih6pqeSpTo clarify: Oxford  UK. Not Oxford  Mississippi  though I am curious about that too.Is there legit ethnic cuisine in Oxford? Going there tonight.I don’t know who made this but my friend Gus Deardoff texted it to me and said it “was from the Internet.” Reminds me of ⁦@DuncanRobson⁩ video at https://t.co/9dt7ILKPJW. https://t.co/kouVkWHLJm@kerobinso @garrytan @SafiBahcall @claychristensen Loonshots much more readable that Innovators Dilemma  which is an academic paper stretched into a trade book. It’s a pleasure to read. Lots of history but also physics-y stuff.@kerobinso @garrytan @SafiBahcall Yah! @SafiBahcall compares that difference to a phase transition  between like water and ice. What causes a company to look for the 1% wins? A lot has to do with how incentives are structured for promotion and raises in an org. And how cut throat it is to move up.@garrytan You should read Loonshots by @SafiBahcall (if you haven’t already). Makes that exact point with many many examples and even a formula in the appendix!@rachelmetz are you in SF on 7/16. Tuesday.FWIW. English was consistently my lowest grade  from 7th grade all the way through senior year. I also used my college core opt-outs to cleverly get around any of the literature requirements. Which is to say  I hope reading the book helps these kids see writing in a new way.@fcoel 🙏Also I knew nothing about the world/life as a high school student  couldn’t say anything really  insightful on many of these novels/plays we read. Like The Scarlet Letter. At 16  how do you understand that hate can be the flip side of love? Or the subtleties in Of Mice and Men.I also think it’s great to see more non-fiction writing on high school curriculum. My education conflated “writing” with literature/fiction. Which meant I didn’t really understand there was writing as a craft outside English essays until pretty late in high school!I think being part of a high school curriculum may be one of the highest honors one could have as an author. It’s kinda exciting influencing young-ish minds and having classroom discussions and essays about your work. (Feels different from college seminars  which is cool too!)This was a lovely email to get. A high school teacher in Wisconsin got a grant to buy 120 copies of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles for the freshman class curriculum. He’s designing the materials now and will give to me to share with other teachers. https://t.co/JygMtMBpdP@rbanksy Totally useless for wiping gelato  and granita  which is what I spilled. That whole mess is a little bit of granita.Someone out there must be able to answer this. Why do napkins in Italy feel like wax paper? They are not absorbent. So it takes 4-5 napkins to wipe up a small spill that 1-2 American napkins could handle. https://t.co/orCHrpOLR9Today I learned that the popular ⁦@NYT_first_said⁩ by ⁦@MaxBittner⁩ forked our ⁦@newsdiffs⁩ repo from Github! https://t.co/8RwhUcuzJqI was an author on the🧣 proposal!

Nor independent enough. But still a fun mind exercise.@fredbenenson I love the Poisson Distribution 🐟! I think it’s one of my favorites.

And just varying hair color with skin tones  but not style 👩🏿👨🏾While this paper makes some interesting points re skintones and emoji  an analysis of emoji and skin tones isn’t complete without mentioning work of Katrina Parrott (⁦@iDiversicons⁩)  the black Texan mom who came up with original skin tone proposal. https://t.co/yj1cSbfvhsGreat to see so many familiar Sundance names (directors  writers  actors  editors) invited into the Academy  including this year’s winner of the Grand Jury Award for US Drama  Chinonye Chukwu!  https://t.co/3HRc31hntm@KevinPayravi Yes.

Here I was thinking less of its experience design and more of its ‘job to be done’ for the ‘players’.@vgr Do you think things like QAnon and alt-everything/conspiracy-Chans act as escapism for some people? More a “meaning and purpose” LARP than actually seeking meaning and purpose.@vgr I guess we’re in my rewatch loop now :)@vgr Ah gotcha. Yeah.

But given our focus on data analysis it makes sense to provide ever-so-slightly more specialization.@ptrbyr @observablehq But in cases like this where it’s a big win for convenience and approachability for a common (the most common!) case  we want to help people get work done.@ptrbyr @observablehq We’re building a lot of other things at the same time  and we’ve been conservative about building things into the platform: it’s a long-term commitment  and we generally favor doing things in “userland” for greater extensibility.@rdmurphy @observablehq Yea  CSV is our most popular type of file attachment!You can now data = FileAttachment("example.csv").csv() in @observablehq. Finally. Rejoice. 🥳@yankeeinlondon @ctheun @observablehq You probably want to look at the size of the bundled libraries rather than the npm packages (which can include build artifacts  tests  etc.). Vega-Lite’s bundle is 78KB minified and gzipped  inclusive; D3’s is 82KB. So  very comparable. And you can build optimized bundles.@tylerneylon You can use all of those techniques with D3 because it allows direct access to the DOM  but if you’re using d3-transition  typically it involves setting up a requestAnimationFrame loop that repeatedly assigns styles or attributes over the duration of the transition.@MAKIO135 @observablehq Thank you!!

But the purifier doesn't work out there (open layout means it can't turn over the air fast enough). Anyone every keynote in an n95? https://t.co/9J455NkohDall day  every day  until air quality gets better. We have to wear an N95 mask TO GO TO THE KITCHEN to get food.

I'm not going into any shops or anything  just stretching legs and getting sun.Went to the @BrooklynBotanic last weekend to catch all the beautiful spring flowers! So nice to see everything coming to life 🌞🌸 https://t.co/D4hSl3zXQy@YoannM @arcanis @addyosmani Yes! Thank you  I'm excited :)@ShaneHudson @addyosmani That’s what I do! It’s useful for very broad stoke measurements  but actual numbers are less accurate.@arcanis @addyosmani @YoannM Sign me up! I’d love to help beta test!@addyosmani While we really liked this plugin  in practice we found that the overhead it added to compilation time made the results very unreliable. Not sure if things have improved since we last used it a ~year ago.@jd__andrade @ScriptedAlchemy Woah! That’s super interesting- thank you!@sophiebits @khanacademy Wow! I didn’t realize that they were using it so extensively! That’s heartening  at least. 😀 (hope you’re doing well Sophie!!)@apaprocki @khanacademy Nice! So given that it seems like somewhere around 1-2mil lines of TS then? I'm curious what sorts of training/guidance you provide for teams to help ensure they write good types!@ajpiano @khanacademy Haha  very much same... everything is Serious Business now - but perhaps for the better! Doesn't mean we can't long for the past 😭What are some of the largest typed JavaScript projects? (either TypeScript or Flow) this answer is a bit dated: https://t.co/PjTKVbQcUS but at @khanacademy we’re getting close to 1 million lines of Flow! (We love the quality that Flow gives us  even if the mindshare is with TS)@mrb_bk @aq Seeing this all come together and how @aq has knocked it out of the park is such an inspiration! Seriously  this is incredible! Can’t wait to visit!@aviflombaum Aww hehe  thank you Avi! 😄@_developit That's quite true! There may be limits to how far it can go without a very large re-architecture.@ericclemmons @ScriptedAlchemy Very interesting! I'm definitely going to dig into this more. I'm not totally sold on doing this at runtime  I suspect that doing it at build time (like WebpackDLL) may have better dev ergonomics and be able to handle server-side rendering better.@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira The way we do it right now (at least for our UI components) is that we can ship multiple versions simultaneously while individual callsites are still being updated (but then eventually re-converging on a single shipped version). For 3rd-party libs it's all-or-nothing.@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira Hmm! I wonder if having independent deploys is mutually exclusive with having shared code? I'd like to hope it's not  but it could be! And maybe that's the issue we're hitting...@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira It seems like the strategies are very focused on letting teams make their own tech decisions - but that doesn't align with what we do. We want a unified central library/toolkit and we want everyone using it (we have that now). Fracturing tools is bad for performance!@kahliltweets @lucamezzalira Very interesting! This seems very focused on separation of concerns  which is good  but it's not clear to me how builds/deploys are working - can the JS services be deployed independently of each other? without having to rebuild everything? how are dependencies shared?@mattwallace Haha  if no one posts an idea then that's what I'll have to research myself! I'm expecting that this is probably what we'll be doing in 2021 or thereabouts  but I want to plan ahead!Khan Academy has 800 000+ lines of JS (not including modules) - no matter how you slice it that's a lot to build either for a deploy or incrementally during development. The smart play seems to break things into smaller chunks (services?) but how do you handle shared code?I haven't seen much written online about doing JS builds that are broken down into "services" that can be deployed independently of each other. Most seem to expect you to build the entire universe on every deploy. Webpack DLLs seem like they might get close - thoughts?@mellowbeing @FutureLearn Ahh -- that looks so cool!! Thank you for the link! 😀@astanley711 Your post was beautiful  thank you so much for sharing! (And your site looks great  too!)Did a mini-interview with @HenriHelvetica on the 14th anniversary of the release of jQuery! A great thread with lots of factoids inside 😊 - thank you Henri! https://t.co/48Q6Zyibu3@scottjehl Both of these things! When we do SSR we do (limited) UA detection to serve up different experiences to older browsers (no point in rendering something old browsers can't use). And also it affects what bundles we serve (e.g. do we need to polyfill a certain browser feature?)@mikesherov @slightlylate @DasSurma This definitely breaks server-side rendering and services like https://t.co/lNWevvBD2b - a huge bummer  are they not listening to users/devs?@HenriHelvetica Hehe  DM is fine!

Any piece can be in at least two places at any given time! We had to map all the vertices and pivot points!@jvhellemond @charis @philhawksworth oh noo wait what do other people call them?Yes! @nervous_system has re-opened orders on one of the best puzzles I've ever done - got it for my family last year and we were entranced for days! https://t.co/Uh1Mynd9WB It's way harder than it seems  especially since the puzzle can wrap around! https://t.co/0lISwY0V3f@bassistance @DocMCohen I found the 3rd print! https://t.co/Py35gYyyo1 so it does seem to be a print as well?@bassistance Found the 2nd one! https://t.co/fuRP3Jac74 not sure about the 3rd though - it doesn't appear to be a print!

They haven't made it available to users and developers but it is there... Now how well it runs on this hardware ks something else I don't know firsthand.@ioiflower @FluorescentGrey Well to be clear all your FM8 and Massive patches for instance will run on Maschine+. And yes it is the Reaktor engine there so they could conceivably open up more on the hardware later.@ShareGamePlay No. See my article for details.@GalacticFurball I mean  that's a bit of a misnomer ... the evolution toward this is because of the controller. These are general-purpose platforms under the hood  which hadn't existed before - and that's not the same as what most other platforms look like.To be clear - you're restricted to what you can do with those engines  versus what you can do on PC. But check the full article for details - https://t.co/dWncnk30MZ@sasQwax They're there already; full FM8  full Massive (1st gen)  the Maschine Drum Synths and FX  plus a number of things that run on top of Reaktor and Komplete - just not the full versions of those.@sasQwax There's a limited amount of space; it's the same size as an MK3 and they use full-sized TRS jacks. I don't know if the USB host port could support CV out or not  but you could use MIDI.@Pixeltuner Well - not yet. But there is a fair bit you can run at launch. The engines are there  so it's down to what they can optimize for the processor there and what they think people will want.This. Maschine+ is NI in a box.

And check glia's stuff  more on that (finally) soon... https://t.co/i61k5O8q6cGonna go ahead and RT this one  because YES... while working on today's Bandcamp list while also working on some music (?) hopefully :D And happy Friday! https://t.co/POYKIMJTrk@Blessed_Madonna You're the only person in this scene I think who knew Thomas Merton or would get the 'shining like the sun' quote; this song sort of made itself and became something between friends when we faced some darkness. https://t.co/4vMsf6fsb7@bram_bos Oh hell yeah! https://t.co/OojdAfpsSo@bram_bos No. Because I splurged on the SA. :D@bleepeater Surely. https://t.co/Fp6Wsd0NkG@gabeastralplane @_frktl Me  too! Oops  but I've procrasinated another writing deadline :D Yeah the other thing that's interesting - Berlin has attracted skilled labor and science since its days as seat of the kingdom of Brandenburg. And it has strong cultural ties to PL  the Baltics  Belarus.Here we go  some words of sanity and science just when we need them - from Jim  who's a terrific journalist (and part of my literal extended family  but that only means I've seen him grow into this role at CNN): https://t.co/fRl12h0JXj@saralandrydj @bleepeater I sometimes go through this process *during a single studio session* but hell yes.@gabeastralplane @_frktl --- but it's a topic for its own investigation. I just think some caution is needed as cities get reduced to caricatures  and maybe they're messier than that. The business techno analysis absolutely holds up.@gabeastralplane @_frktl They may be more similar than that comparison would imply. NYC does have a significant amount of public and private funding for arts  albeit not as often granted directly to individuals. Berlin and DE zoning and policy is currently favoring FIRE in a number of ways.@gabeastralplane @_frktl I did once see an enormous painting of Sven hanging in a real estate office in Mitte  so it is at least *conceivable* you're right. ;)@gabeastralplane @_frktl That is  NYC squandered its chance to really invest in culture and science. Berlin - verdict is still out. I also would say *pre*-pandemic (even post to some extent) it's worth looking at artists who moved from a NYC (or for more contrast Detroit) *to* Berlin.@gabeastralplane @_frktl Aha  ok - though FIRE in Berlin is unlike NYC or Lndn  uh  yet. (gulp) It's also unclear to me how much that's "cool techno" versus "this is now the capital of Europe and the seat of government." Keep in mind Internet tech grew *faster* than tourism/ent in recent yrs.@gabeastralplane @_frktl Definitely - and saving this to read a couple of times over again. I do have to push back a bit on dumping on the capital cities  though - there is also excitement to density  as hubs attract people  across disciplines  no? I wonder if it's necessary to reduce them to evils.@audiotecna @Chris_Randall Here you go  for people who *haven't* heard Peter play. This whole show was beautiful.

Well also between now and November will be building some new places for sharing + learning.@alan_oldham @SoundCloud Oh  but... stay tuned  will do a feature soon talking to some engineers  I know  uh  I could be not as terrible as I am at mixing and mastering :D@alan_oldham @SoundCloud I'm a pain in the ass about this only because - there was an opportunity to make that tool more music-friendly  and in the end  they went with an approach that appeals to people wanting an FM radio sound.@Chris_Randall Me  too  though I realized then I made that reference in Russia and people had no idea what I was talking about. The closest reference there was apparently there were all-Union satellite programs with Communist dignitaries. Uh... not quite the same. USSR proto-Zoom  though.Great to see @djspooky + Dave Smith of @sequentialLLC + @KakiKing + Jayson Dobsey of the @metmuseum instruments collection as the judges  too. Thanks to @GeorgiaTech music tech program + Jason Freeman.I think there really is a chance in the midst of all the anti-science stuff going on in the world to raise the visibility of people making their own stuff - and support access to engineering and science.Spread the word - deadline October 1 for futuristic musical instruments!

Hell of a playable instrument!@audiotecna @Chris_Randall That was an affectionate jest on my part  obviously. I tell viola jokes too. And yes... Well our friend Петер Термéн is pretty great but it does run in the family 😂Oh yeah  also - PSA. The good kind of chaos. The no-iLok kind of free. https://t.co/VEvtDdiIVrVery much welcome other tips re: journalism out there. (Yeah  remember that?) And while you're at it  *at least* don't sleep on the great stuff coming from @hueymnemonic ...Essential start to the back-to-school syllabus. It's music  so the syllabus also includes listening. https://t.co/U3wGwA56zuWonderful that some things even just exist. Like if William Blake got a monome and learned Lua... https://t.co/oSnrbxrZck@Chris_Randall Should be pretty easy. Just protest by playing chords. Or in tune. ;)@mypandashallfly @zunaito Also - it's not like I'm begrudging artists who can't afford engineers. These services do have a business model  and it isn't free. Someone is profiting at the expense of actual engineers  and it is possible to teach producers how to master their own stuff and retain control.@zunaito @mypandashallfly Right  but then - they're producing the music on a tool capable of doing the job. The issue is  the cloud stuff takes control out of their hands. It devalues both the producer *and* the mastering engineer.@mypandashallfly @zunaito I'm not questioning artists using automated services. The issue is then  do these tools meet those artists' needs and give them adequate control and output? And they don't. I've tried them.@sinhadeb Well and if they don't you have someone to yell at  too. ;)@aetheric_co Sure. Then again  in 2020  mastering engineers can just ask  "how did cutting your own hair work out for you? Now you understand."@piesaac I cured my gout with a combination of hot yoga and Schenkerian analysis  but only after retuning to 432 Hz. It can work for you.@aetheric_co But it is. Locally on your machine you can see how stuff works. Even if it's obfuscated in the plugin - and in most it really is not - you still have the actual signal. So there is a difference  really.Don't trust me  though. I live in a city full of shady leftists who dress in black and embrace let's say a Theremin communist lifestyle.Reason to be afraid - POTUS reveals that Biden is being controlled by Dark Shadows. https://t.co/TxgAxmquy0@aetheric_co But then why not simplified overall loudness controls? Those could work for beginners without overly warping their content.@snikolov Yeah  but they do the opposite. They're designed like black boxes. And the output doesn't really make sense either. Tools from Waves or iZotope or Eventide or built into your DAW have presets that work better than these and tons of educational materials.So yes  I guess since this is coming up again  probably I should get some flame-retardant clothes and we should talk more on @cdmblogs about this.And now  knowing so many talented artists out of work  yeah  this is a social justice issue. Automating away their labor for your VC-backed tech company is not very okay. Not that anyone asked. Wait  I may have just said a bunch of things I believe in public again. Oops.But why would you tell someone who has done something as complicated as making a track with today's insanely-complex DAWs and plug-ins that they "want" a Fisher Price-styled end point dumber than most Instagendpointram settings? It doesn't compute.Anyone producing music also is using a ton of sophisticated tools. If they want fast results  they can also just use a plug-in and presets and *still* have more choice than these tools offer - and then they should go back later  turn that s*** off  and hire someone.Some of the people who worked on those products  yeah  I know you know me  but probably you don't want me to write about this. ;) No fault to you trying  I just think it's the wrong approach.I'm not even a mastering engineer  so you can trust me. This. LANDR  SoundCloud automated mastering - look  they don't work. They're anti-human  anti-music  they miss the whole point of what an engineer does. https://t.co/dah2Mw5pTE@drmathys_ Yes  exactly! I should go back and reread this...@drmathys_ That doesn't surprise me at all. And I don't have much hope for the USA in this regard now  either  because 2020 census is a total mess. Been talking to my parents; my mom is working as a census worker.@drmathys_ But you know  now seems like a good moment  right? I see Polish friends protesting anti-Black racism in Warsaw. And people immigrating back from all post-colonial areas to Europe  so the decolonializing conversation now has everyone involved at the table :)@drmathys_ I always thought at least for Latinx-  Arab-  Asian-[USA] Americans  etc.  who can pass in various ways  reclaiming identity could help. But it's complex - generational gaps  mixed-race backgrounds  and you need to still work together *and* recognize privilege.@drmathys_ It's the whole history of the USA  too. It's not just "assimilation"; it's been a contest to become more white  at the expense of other immigrant groups  and piling even more discrimination and exclusion on Black Americans.Let's see  in stressful times people like comforts so ... why not Live 1 and Live 2 skins as Live 10 themes? ;) https://t.co/Oum4eOrPucHere's your Monday morning moment of contemplation :) https://t.co/fKMpYaE4PM@jaytholen @DoctorLlamaLord Some people just don't appreciate great UX. ;)@poemproducer That's gorgeous  wow! &lt;3@szk_1992 Excellent. Keep me posted on this one.@poemproducer Yeah  but even viewing this as the USA versus Europe is rooted in antiquated thinking. The whole point is the oligopoly - AMZN MS APPL Google Facebook.

Remarkable in itself  though. What is true is that In the past 50 years Republican presidents have increased the debt way more than Democratic Presidents.@1bsdetector @SharylAttkisson Uh ok. So don’t take my word for it. Try googling “what does payroll tax pay for” and this is the first result.Quote: “payroll taxes are used to finance social insurance programs  such as Social Security and Medicare.”https://t.co/I1MBnFZfNm@dudeinnchicago @JonKinnas @SharylAttkisson This is from the Social Security Office.

It’s just kicking the can down the road. And Trump said he wants to make it permanent  which would affect those programs pretty severely if you ask me.@stanley3smith3 @Improbably11 @SharylAttkisson Both Republican and Democratic Presidents have been racking up the debt for 50 years. There’s equal blame to go around. Trump knew this and still promised that he would eliminate the debt. Not sure what his brilliant plan was  but it definitely had the opposite effect.@SharylAttkisson Trump pledged to abolish the payroll taxes that pay for Medicare and Social Security. Is he going to pay for those services in some other way?

>9717342.0,i have to go back in time and stop robert mosesI just got an email from Steam with the subject line "Everything and one other item from your Steam wishlist is now on sale!"It took me a while to realize that "Everything" is the name of a game on my wishlist.@humphd A funny thing is that the website I made for my employer is always referred to as an "app" by the media  even though we only ever call it a website. The only reason this is frustrating is because it means some people will be searching the app stores for it  rather than the web.

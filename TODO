Twitter Bias Project:
  ☐ Come Up with some ways to represent the data in interesting ways, idealy 3-5 different ways @created(20-09-05 20:10)
    ☐ word cloud of the most popular words from all the accounts @created(20-09-05 21:17)
    ☐ A chart on the top 30 words combining all the users @created(20-09-05 21:17)
      ** that would be counting the total in each word and plotting the top 30 or so words
    ☐ A chart of words most used by different people @created(20-09-05 21:17)
      ** This is different to most common words more the how many times its used by each user.
        Each word will be counted once per user then that number will be ploted.
  ☐ Find a better way of cleaning the data @created(20-09-05 20:12)
    The problem is the URL's arnet being removed
  ☐ Research a better way of dealing with such a large dataset @created(20-09-05 20:16)
    One idea for this is to have a batch size saved in memory and then when that batch size is filled save it out to a file.
      What file format would this have to be save out as i.e. json file or a csv file?
